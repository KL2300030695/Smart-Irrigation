# Smart Irrigation System
This project is an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage and improve plant health. By leveraging real-time data from soil moisture sensors, the system automates the watering process, ensuring plants receive the precise amount of moisture they need.

# Key Features & Benefits:
Significant Water Conservation: Reduces water consumption by up to 70% compared to traditional, time-based systems.

Enhanced Plant Health: Promotes stronger root systems and higher crop yields by preventing both under- and over-watering.

Full Automation: Eliminates the manual labor of watering, saving time and effort.

Remote Monitoring & Control: A web dashboard or mobile app allows you to monitor your system and control it from anywhere.

Data-Driven Insights: Collects and displays historical data, helping you refine your watering strategy over time for maximum efficiency.

This repository contains the code for the controller (e.g., Arduino/ESP32), and instructions for setting up the hardware and user interface.
